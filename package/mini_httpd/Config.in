	 mini_httpd is a small HTTP server. Its performance is not great, but for 
	 low or medium traffic sites it's quite adequate. It implements all the 
	 basic features of an HTTP server, including:
	 
	     * GET, HEAD, and POST methods.
	     * CGI.
	     * Basic authentication.
	     * Security against ".." filename snooping.
	     * The common MIME types.
	     * Trailing-slash redirection.
	     * index.html, index.htm, index.cgi
	     * Directory listings.
	     * Multihoming / virtual hosting.
	     * Standard logging.
	     * Custom error pages. 
	 
	 It can also be configured to do SSL/HTTPS and IPv6.
