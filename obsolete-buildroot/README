This is a modified uClibc buildroot, customized to build OpenWRT.
NOTE! This tarball is meant to be unpacked on top of a stock uClibc
buildroot directory as it only include the necessary customizations!

If you already have the linksys tarball (check make/openwrt.mk for the
version used), then move/copy/symlink it into sources/dl.  At the
moment (2004/03/05) I'm using wrt54gv2.2.02.2.tgz.

Simply running 'make' will build openwrt-code.bin and a tarball of
the kernel modules.  Customizations of the kernel, uClibc, and busybox
are possible by modifying the appropriate config files in source.
Copies of the stock openwrt Makefile, uClibc.config, busybox.config,
are included with a '-openwrt' suffix.

Remember that different configurations of uClibc may not be binary
compatible.  Also, uClibc is not necessarily binary compatible between
versions.  In particular, dynamicly linked applications and libraries
built with the linksys/broadcom toolchain are NOT binary compatible
with current uClibc.
