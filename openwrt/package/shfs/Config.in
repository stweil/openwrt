	  ShFS is a simple and easy to use Linux kernel module which 
	  allows you to mount remote filesystems using a plain shell 
	  (SSH) connection. When using ShFS, you can access all remote 
	  files just like the local ones, only the access is governed 
	  through the transport security of SSH.
	  
	  ShFS supports some nice features:
	  
	   * file cache for access speedup
	   * perl and shell code for the remote (server) side
	   * could preserve uid/gid (root connection)
	   * number of remote host platforms (Linux, Solaris, Cygwin, ...)
	   * Linux kernel 2.4.10+ and 2.6
	   * arbitrary command used for connection (instead of SSH)
	   * persistent connection (reconnect after SSH dies)
