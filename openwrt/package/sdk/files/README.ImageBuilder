This is the OpenWrt Image Builder. You can use it to make customized
OpenWrt Images without having to compile anything.

Just put all the extra packages you need in packages/ and make changes
to target_skeleton if you like.

After that run 'make' and it will build the OpenWrt images in the bin/
directory.
