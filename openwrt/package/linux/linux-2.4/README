Description of kernel patches in patches:

000-linux-mips.patch
	This is the diff between vanilla linux-2.4.30 and linux-mips.org kernel
	(CVS tag 2_4_30 used). The kernel source from linux-mips.org CVS repository has
	newer drivers and code then vanilla linux-2.4.30 especially for the mips architecture.

001-bcm47xx.patch
	This is the broadcom specific code from netgear (wg602v3-GPL-v1.0.6) GPL source tarball. 
	There are many small patches included, so it works with linux 2.4.30 kernel. 
	The original code is based on Linux 2.4.20.

002-wl-fix.patch
	The driver for the wireless lan chip on brcm47xx based routers is binary only. 
	This means it depends on older data structures in the kernel. We backported some
	of the changes or changed some of the data structures to work with the binary modul. 
	This is a really bad hack, but without source code, there is no better chance to get
	the driver working with newer kernels.

003-squashfs.patch
	Support for the squashfs filesystem. It has better compression ratio then cramfs.

004-squashfs-lzma.patch
	LZMA Addon patch from Oleg I. Vdovikin for the squashfs filesystem. 
	Even better compression ratio. 

005-jffs2-compression.patch
	Compression for jffs2 filesystem.
	
100-ebtables.patch
	Filtering packets on ethernet layer. See http://ebtables.sf.net
