	  A driver for 802.11b wireless cards based on Intersil Prism2/2.5/3
	  chipset. This driver supports so called Host AP mode that allows
	  the card to act as an IEEE 802.11 access point.
	  
	  This option includes the base Host AP driver code that is shared by
	  different hardware models. You will also need to enable support for
	  PLX/PCI/CS version of the driver to actually use the driver.
