This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux Distribution
It is a modified uClibc buildroot2.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

Simply running 'make' will build your firmware and a tarball
of kernel modules. It will download all sources, build the 
cross-compile toolchain, the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use flash.sh for remotely updating your embedded system
via tftp.


There are some cleanup targets we would like to explain.
"make clean" will only clean the firmware images and the root
filesystem. "make dirclean" will remove the extracted kernel source
and all exctracted software. (busybox,bridge-utils,..), but will
preserve your toolchain. (compiler,linker,..)
"make distclean" will remove everything, including the toolchain, 
all downloaded source code archives and your firmware configuration. 
You can cleanup separate directories by using "make application-dirclean" 
and rebuild the firmware with "make".

Be happy..
