This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution
It is a modified uClibc buildroot2.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

Simply running 'make' will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use scripts/flash.sh for remotely updating your embedded system
via tftp.

The buildroot system is documented in docs/buildroot-documentation.html.
